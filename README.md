The documention of American Express Challenge README

## Gerenal Idea
Today's idea is as follows:
* Geo-Position Features: A map which shows all small businesses which have partnership with **AMEX**

* Subscription & Award Points Features: feature implemented within the **AMEX mobile app** that shows the 
customer their current subscriptions with American Express's partnerships - better manage their account and improve
the digital customer experience since a pain point is solved (all subscription bills are displayed
in the same place and that makes things more organised).
This should be linked to **AMEX membership reward program** - the current situation is that customers
earn points when they use the AMEX credit card and can redeem those points to purchase AMEX partner products.
One potential idea is to link the subscription feature to the membership reward program: points can be redeemed 
to continue subscriptions (other purchases such as drinks, coffes, meals will be still available).
This is to increase revenue and exposure of the prime services that our partners offer.

* Recommendation Feature: History on purchasing, discounts, custmized preferences etc. (50%)
We could implement PUSH-UP notifications. Based on
  - Customer purchase history and preferences
  AND
  - Total points that can be redeemed at the moment
Top choices and options (ie., in a ranking) could be suggested to the customer. Data ins constantly received and ML models are
constantly updated.
